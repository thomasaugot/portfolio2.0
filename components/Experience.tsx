        With nearly two years of experience, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to
        contribute to and complete over 15 projects of varying sizes. These
        projects range from personal endeavors to startup initiatives. Through
        these experiences, I have developed the ability to work effectively both
        independently and as part of a team.
